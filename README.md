# Java MOOC

This repository contains my solutions to the Java exercises in the MOOC Java Course offered by the University of Helsinki.

## Introduction

As I progress through the course, I will be uploading my answers to the exercises in this repository. The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and share my code with others who are also learning Java.

The MOOC Java Course is a free, online course that provides a comprehensive introduction to Java programming. You can find more information and sign up for the course on the [University of Helsinki's website](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/).

## Contents

The repository is organized by Parts, and each Part contains several exercises. Each exercise has its own directory, which contains the solution file and any necessary resources.

## Contributing

If you have any suggestions or corrections for my code, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the University of Helsinki for providing such a comprehensive and informative course on Java programming.
